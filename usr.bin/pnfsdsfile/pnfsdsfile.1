.Sh NAME
.Nm pnfsdsfile
.Nd display
a pNFS data storage file location and/or modify the pnfsd.dsfile extended attribute for it
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl qz
.Op Fl s Ar dshostname
.Ar metadata_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays the location of a data storage file for a pNFS service and/or
modifies the pnfsd.dsfile extended attribute on the file.
A pNFS service maintains a data storage file for each regular file on
the MetaData Server (MDS) on one of the Data Storage (DS) servers.
Unless command options are specified, this command displays the location
of the DS file for the MDS file specified by the last command line argument.
It must be used on the MDS and the
.Ar metadata_file
must be a file on the exported local file system and not an NFSv4.1 mount.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl q
This option suppresses printing of the DS file's location.
.It Fl z
This option specifies that the file handle field of the pnfsd.dsfile
extended attribute is to filled with all zero bits.
This forces the pNFS MDS to do a Lookup RPC against the DS to acquire the file
handle to update it.
Normally this will only be necessary after the DS file has been recovered
from a backup, causing the file handle to change.
.It Fl s Ar dshostname
This option can be used with
.Fl z
so that the zeroing out of the file handle is only done if the DS server
is the one specified by this option.
